## Rubric Points
### The code compiles correctly.
The given code compiles without any error. I have included `splice.h` file in the /src folder in project directory. Project can be built using the instructions found in README file

### The car is able to drive at least 4.32 miles without incident
The car ran smoothly for around 11 miles without incident. Please find the screen shot below.

### The car drives according to the speed limit.
Car drives within the speed limit of 50 mph. 

### Max Acceleration and Jerk are not Exceeded.
Acceleration and jerk were within limits at any point of time.

### Car does not have collisions.
No collision occurred.

### The car stays in its lane, except for the time between changing lanes.
Car stays in the center of the lane except when changing lanes. Changing lanes also takes within 3 seconds.

### The car is able to change lanes
The car is able to change lanes when there is a slow car ahead and changing lane benefits speed of the car. Also car returns to the center lane when there is no car in center lane.

## Discussion of model

The whole code exists on the `main.cpp` file in the /src folder. The path planning consists of three steps/activities. They are :

 1. Prediction
 2. Behavior Planning
 3. Trajectory Generation
 
 ### Prediction
 In prediction step we acquire the data from the sensor fusion and other modules to know better about our car's surroundings. We predict the other car's action which might effect us. Like, do we have any car in front of us which is obstructing our way ?, etc. The code for the prediction part is from line 250 to 293 in main.cpp file

### Behavior Planning
Behavior planning is the actual decision making part of the path planner. We have different scenarios according to which our model(car) changes the states (in this case, lanes). It is similar to Finite State Models which are used to model system transitions, based on definitive conditions. Here we make decisions about changing lanes, if it is safe to change lane or to remain in same lane, etc. The code for behavior planning is from line 295 to 319 in main.cpp file.

### Trajectory Generation
This is the final step in our path planner. After making decisions in the behavior part, we make trajectory, that the car will follow. Trajectory is generated by producing 50 waypoints the car would take in the future at the given moment. These way points are then fed to the simulator via uWebSocket. 
In this project we use Spline library to generate the trajectory instead of polynomial fit. The reason for this is spline produces a smoother fit than the regular polyfit function. While generating trajectory we consider the previously generated waypoints and include them in the current trajectory which ensures that the transition is smooth.

The code for behavior planning is from line 321 to 319 in main.cpp file.
